 * Apps Script serves the /exec response through a PER-DEPLOYMENT
 * user-content host of the form
 *   https://n-<opaque-hash>-script.googleusercontent.com
 * so the bare googleusercontent host listed below is never the observed
 * origin, and the receipt is posted by Apps Script's inner wrapper frame

 * list alone therefore rejected every valid receipt, and the request
 * failed with API_TIMEOUT. isAllowedResponseOrigin handles the
 * per-deployment host.

 * inside the HTTPS form post. Origin is a coarse filter; the nonce is
